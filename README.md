# Farmageddon

Cat overloads project for Software Development practice.
Farmageddon is a farming simulator where you can manage a farm and fight zombies.

You play as a hero who has been thrown into an apocalyptic world. The world is full of zombies and the only option is to survive. Your mission is to establish a base, cultivate crops, raise livestock, and defend your estate from ferociously mindless beasts.
